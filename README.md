# Creation-of-Biological-Entity-Database-for-a-Lab
this contains the code written for the MSc Bioinformatics course - Programming and Databases for Biologists (Timed Test, Half Hour). grade: A3

The following was the test question - 
You are part of a biological research group at a university that is focusing on the interactions between various proteins and genetic markers associated with human diseases. Your task is to design a database that can effectively store, manage, and retrieve data about these biological entities. You are given an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that shows the entities, attributes and relationships that need to be in the database. Your task is to write the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to create the database tables based on the provided ERD. Include constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints that you think are necessary for data integrity and consistency. Make sure to consider the proper data types for each attribute and relationship.
